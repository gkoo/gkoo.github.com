      Hi. My name is Gordon Koo. I'm a software developer in the San Francisco Bay Area, currently working at
      <a href='http://www.linkedin.com'>LinkedIn</a>, a site aimed at connecting professionals. Here is my
      <a href='http://www.linkedin.com/in/gordonkoo'>LinkedIn profile</a>.

      In my freshman year of college, my dorm resident assistant
      put a guitar in my hands and taught me a handful of chords
      and the basics of strumming. Since then, I've become quite
      fond of playing guitar (and more recently, ukulele) and
      it's my most frequent and enjoyed hobby today.

      I like to work on websites. I suppose that's a good trait
      to have for someone in my profession. My proclivity to
      work on personal projects outside of work started with
      my discovery of
      <a href='http://blog.linkedin.com/topic/linkedin-indays/linkedin-hackdays/'>LinkedIn's Hackdays</a>, an internal event
      hosted every month where employees are encouraged to work
      on side projects and learn about new technologies.
